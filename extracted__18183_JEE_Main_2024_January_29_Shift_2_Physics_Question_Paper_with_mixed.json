      "difficulty": "tough",
      "hint": "The radius of a charged particle's path in a magnetic field depends on its mass, charge, velocity, and magnetic field strength. Since both charges are accelerated through the same potential, their kinetic energies are equal, leading to a relationship between their velocities and masses.",

      "correct_answer": 2,
      "difficulty": "tough",
      "hint": "Use Hooke's Law and the concept of Young's modulus. Since the elongations are the same, the ratio of forces can be determined by the cross-sectional areas and lengths of the blocks.",
