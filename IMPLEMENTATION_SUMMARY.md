## 🔧 **1️⃣ PDF Upload & Extraction Fix (New Format)**

### **✅ New PDF Format Support**
The system now fully supports the exact format:
```
Question: <question text>
Options:
(a) <option a>
(b) <option b>
(c) <option c>
(d) <option d>
Answer: (<correct option letter>)
```

### **✅ Advanced Content Cleaning**
- **PDF Content Cleaning**: Removes headers, footers, ads (24.3% size reduction in tests)
- **Question Text Cleaning**: Strips advertising and promotional content
- **Option Text Cleaning**: Handles merged content and truncates ads perfectly
- **Smart Filtering**: 
  - ✅ Skips numeric/integer questions (`"Calculate the value of 5 + 3 × 2"`)
  - ✅ Skips match-the-following questions (`"Match Column A with Column B"`)
  - ✅ Validates exactly 4 clean options after processing

### **✅ AI Extraction Logic**
- **OpenRouter Integration**: 27+ AI models with single API key
- **Content Preprocessing**: Text cleaned before AI processing
- **Smart Validation**: Only processes valid MCQs with 4 options
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Specialized for new PDF format with cleaning instructions
- **Image Detection**: Generates hints for questions with visual content

### **✅ Regex Fallback Logic**  
- **New Format Pattern**: `r'Question:\s*(.+?)\s*Options:\s*\n\s*\(a\)\s*(.+?)...Answer:\s*\(([a-d])\)'`
- **Content Cleaning**: Same cleaning rules as AI extraction
- **Answer Mapping**: Perfect (a)(b)(c)(d) → 0,1,2,3 conversion
- **Robust Processing**: Handles multiline questions and special characters

### **✅ Difficulty Classification**
- **Easy Upload Mode**: Text-only → Easy, Image-based → Tough
- **Tough Upload Mode**: ALL questions → Tough  
- **Mixed Upload Mode**: Smart classification based on content complexity
- **Hint Generation**: Contextual hints for tough questions and images

### **✅ Database Integration**
- **Full Compatibility**: Existing `QuizQuestion` schema unchanged
- **Enhanced Storage**: Supports `hint`, `difficulty`, `exam_type` fields
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, no system crashes on failures
- **Extraction Tracking**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring

---

## 📋 **2️⃣ Bulk Delete in Admin Panel**

### **✅ Frontend (React) Updates**
- **Checkboxes**: Added to each question for selection
- **Select All**: Checkbox to select/deselect all questions
- **Delete Selected Button**: Appears when questions are selected
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner during bulk delete operations
- **Selection Counter**: Displays number of selected questions

### **✅ Backend (Flask) Implementation**
- **Route**: `POST /api/admin/questions/delete-bulk`
- **Input**: JSON array of `question_ids`  
- **Soft Delete**: Sets `is_active=false` instead of hard deletion
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple questions efficiently
- **Error Tracking**: Returns success/failure counts for each operation

### **✅ Database Updates**
- **Model Enhancement**: Added `is_active` field to `QuizQuestion`
- **Soft Delete**: Questions marked inactive instead of deleted
- **Query Filtering**: Active questions only returned by default
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing queries work unchanged

### **✅ API Integration**
```javascript
const deleteSelectedQuestions = async (selectedIds) => {
    await axios.post("/api/admin/questions/delete-bulk", { 
        question_ids: selectedIds 
    });
    // Refresh question list after deletion
};
```

## 📝 **Usage Instructions**

### **PDF Upload (Enhanced)**
1. Navigate to Admin Panel → Upload PDF tab
2. Select PDF file with new format
3. Choose difficulty mode (Easy/Tough/Mixed)  
4. System automatically:
   - Detects new format
   - Cleans content (removes ads)
   - Filters invalid questions
   - Extracts with AI (27+ models)
   - Falls back to regex if needed
   - Stores in database with hints

### **Bulk Delete (New)**
1. Navigate to Admin Panel → Questions tab
2. Use checkboxes to select questions
3. Click "Select All" for bulk selection
4. Click "Delete Selected (N)" button
5. Confirm deletion in popup
6. Questions marked as inactive (soft delete)
7. Question list refreshes automatically

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **PDF Extraction Pipeline**
```
PDF File → Content Cleaning → Format Detection → AI Extraction (27 models) 
    ↓ (if AI fails)
Regex Fallback → Question Validation → Content Cleaning → Database Storage
```

### **Bulk Delete Pipeline**  
```
Frontend Selection → API Call → Batch Processing → Soft Delete (is_active=false) 
    ↓
Database Update → Success Response → Frontend Refresh
```

### **Key Files Modified**
- `backend/app/models/quiz_question.py` - Added `is_active` field
- `backend/app/routes/admin.py` - Added bulk delete endpoint  
- `backend/app/services/openrouter_pdf_extractor.py` - Enhanced extraction
- `frontend/src/pages/Admin.js` - Added bulk delete UI
