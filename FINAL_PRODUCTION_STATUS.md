## ⚠️ **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

### **Minor Issues (Non-blocking)**
1. **MongoDB Logging**: Authentication errors in development (logging only, doesn't affect core functionality)
2. **Rate Limiting Storage**: Uses in-memory storage (fine for single instance, upgrade to Redis for scaling)
3. **PDF Processing Time**: 2-5 minutes for large files (dependent on AI API speed)

### **Scalability Considerations**
- **Current Capacity**: 50-100 concurrent users (limited by single instance)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL can handle the load, consider read replicas for >1000 users
- **File Storage**: Local storage for PDFs, consider AWS S3 for production scale
- **Session Management**: In-memory sessions, upgrade to Redis for horizontal scaling
