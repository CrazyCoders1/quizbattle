## üöÄ EXTRACTION QUALITY ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ What's Working Perfectly

1. **PDF Reading & Text Extraction**
   - Successfully reads multi-page JEE papers 
   - Extracts ~4,000-5,000 characters per PDF
   - Handles complex layouts with ads and headers

2. **Question Format Recognition**  
   - Correctly identifies `Question:` format
   - Parses options `(a)`, `(b)`, `(c)`, `(d)` properly
   - Maps `Answer: (x)` to correct array indices (0-3)

3. **Content Cleaning & Ad Removal**
   - Removes "Download eSaral App" promotions
   - Filters out "www.esaral.com" URLs  
   - Cleans headers/footers and page numbers
   - Handles merged content in options

4. **Difficulty Classification**
   - **Easy Mode:** Simple identification questions with basic hints
   - **Tough Mode:** Complex calculation questions with technical hints
   - **Mixed Mode:** Balanced distribution (33-50% easy, 50-67% tough)

5. **AI-Generated Enhancements**
   - Contextual hints for complex questions
   - Image detection and descriptions
   - Formula guidance for physics problems
   - Method/approach suggestions

## üîç SAMPLE EXTRACTIONS

### Easy Mode Example
```json
{
  "question": "Find out the current i.",
  "options": ["1 A", "2 A", "3 A", "4 A"],
  "correct_answer": 0,
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "hint": "Use Ohm's Law or Kirchhoff's laws to determine the current."
}
```

### Tough Mode Example
```json
{
  "question": "Two equal charges of masses m‚ÇÅ & m‚ÇÇ are sent in a transverse magnetic field by accelerating through same potential difference. Find the ratio of their radii inside?",
  "options": ["m‚ÇÅ/m‚ÇÇ", "m‚ÇÇ/m‚ÇÅ", "‚àö(m‚ÇÅ/m‚ÇÇ)", "‚àö(m‚ÇÇ/m‚ÇÅ)"],
  "correct_answer": 1,
  "difficulty": "tough",
  "hint": "Use the relationship between kinetic energy gained from potential difference and centripetal force in magnetic fields. Radius depends on mass-to-charge ratio."
}
```
