# 🚀 Netlify Frontend Deployment - FIXED Configuration

**Issue Resolved:** Removed Python confusion, now pure React/Node.js deployment

---

## ✅ **Updated Netlify Settings**

### **Site Configuration:**
```
Site name: quizbattle-frontend
Repository: CrazyCoders1/quizbattle  
Branch to deploy: main
Base directory: frontend
Build command: npm install && npm run build
Publish directory: build
```

### **Environment Variables:**
```
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://quizbattle-backend.onrender.com/api
```

---

## 🎯 **What's Fixed:**

- ❌ **Removed**: `runtime.txt` and `.python-version` from root
- ✅ **Added**: `frontend/.nvmrc` for Node.js 18
- ✅ **Updated**: `netlify.toml` with proper base directory
- ✅ **Simplified**: Build commands for React-only deployment

---

## 🚀 **Deploy Now:**

1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. **Retry deployment** (auto picks up changes)
3. **Or create new site** with above settings
4. Should build successfully with Node.js only!

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Node.js 18 installation
- ✅ npm install in frontend directory  
- ✅ React build successful
- ✅ Site deployed to https://quizbattle-frontend.netlify.app
